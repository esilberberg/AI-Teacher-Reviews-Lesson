## What will you learn?
This tutorial will introduce you to using the Google Gemini API with Python to create your own custom AI tools. You'll explore how AI-driven sentiment analysis of student feedback can be applied to teacher performance reviews. You'll also learn techniques like prompt engineering to produce more useful analyses. By experimenting with Gemini, you'll gain a deeper understanding of the technology and, consequently, a more critical perspective on the potential use of AI in teacher performance reviews.

## Who is this tutorial for?
The primary audience for this tutorial is educators and school administrators interested in exploring the technical aspects of AI in teacher evaluation. A secondary audience includes those looking to get acquainted with the Gemini API and sentiment analysis. It was originally offered as a workshop at the [Queens College Library](https://library.qc.cuny.edu/). You are welcome to use it for other workshops or self-study.

A basic understanding of Python is required.
